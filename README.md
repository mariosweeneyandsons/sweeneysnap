## What is SweeneySnap?

SweeneySnap turns any event into an interactive photo experience. Guests scan a QR code, take a selfie, and watch it appear on the big screen in real time. No app download, no sign-up, no friction — just point, snap, and smile.

Perfect for corporate events, weddings, conferences, activations, and anywhere you want to get people involved.

## How It Works

**1. Create your event**
Set up your event in the admin dashboard — add branding, configure the display, and generate a QR code.

**2. Guests scan and snap**
Attendees scan the QR code with their phone, take a selfie, and optionally add their name or a message.

**3. Photos hit the big screen**
Approved selfies flow onto the display wall in real time — a dynamic, ever-growing mosaic of your event.
